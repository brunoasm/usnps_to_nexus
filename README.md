# unlinked_snps_to_nexus.py
A simple script that converts unlinked_snps files produced by [pyRAD](https://github.com/dereneaton/pyrad) to a NEXUS file suitable for SNAPP.
The input files are simply phylip alignments in which heterozygous individuals are coded by ambiguities, missing data by N and gaps by -.

## Usage
To show help: `python unlinked_snps_to_nexus.py -h`

### Parameters
* Required: path to \*.unlinked_snps file generated by pyRAD
* Optional: **-p** path to \*.csv file containing population assignments. This file must column named 'sample', with sample names as in \*.unlinked_snps file, and another named 'population', with population names.
In the NEXUS file produced, population will be appended to sample name, separated by underline. In BEAUTi, this can be used to quickly set populations by using button **GUESS**.

## Output
The program outputs a nexus file to the directory where it is called, named according to the input file.
If any alignment column has more than 2 alleles, a warning is given and this column is ommited from output.
N's and -'s are converted to ? in the output.


## Example

```bash
python unlinked_snps_to_nexus.py my_file.unlinked_snps -p pop_table.csv
```
This will produce a file named **my_file.nex** in the current directory, which can be loaded by BEAUTi.
