# usnps_to_nexus
A simple script that converts [pyRAD](https://github.com/dereneaton/pyrad) unlinked_snps file to a NEXUS file suitable for SNAPP.

## Usage
To show help: `python unlinked_snps_to_nexus.py -h`

### Parameters
Required: path to *.unlinked_snps file generated by pyRAD
Optional: path to *.csv file containing population assignments. This file must column named 'sample', with sample names as in *.unlinked_snps file, and another named 'population', with population names.

In the NEXUS file produced, population will be appended to sample name, separated by underline. In BEAUTi, this can be used to quickly set populations by using button **GUESS**.

### Example

```bash
python unlinked_snps_to_nexus.py my_file.unlinked_snps -p pop_table.csv
```
This will produce a file named **my_file.nex** in the current directory, which can be loaded by BEAUTi
